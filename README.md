## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20.x or 22.x
- Forge CLI: `npm install -g @forge/cli`
- Two Jira Cloud instances with admin access

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SerdarAbali/jira-sync-connector.git
cd jira-sync-connector
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

3. **Login to Forge**
```bash
forge login
```

4. **Deploy to Jira**
```bash
forge deploy
forge install
```

5. **Configure the app**
   - Go to Jira Settings → Apps → Manage your apps
   - Find "Sync Connector" and click Configure
   - Fill in remote Jira details (URL, email, API token, project key)
   - Click "Load Remote Data" and "Load Local Data"
   - Configure mappings for users, fields, and statuses
   - Save each mapping section

## 📖 Usage

### Dual Sync Strategy
The app uses two complementary sync mechanisms for maximum reliability:

**Real-time Webhook Syncs**
- Triggers instantly when issues are created, updated, or commented
- Provides immediate synchronization (typically 1-3 seconds)
- Tracks: issues created, issues updated, comments synced, errors

**Scheduled Bulk Syncs (Hourly)**
- Runs every hour to catch any missed syncs
- Checks all issues in allowed projects for sync requirements
- Ensures eventual consistency and catches webhook failures
- Tracks: issues checked, created, updated, skipped, errors

**Why Both?**
- Webhooks provide instant sync for active work
- Scheduled sync catches edge cases (missed webhooks, network issues, etc.)
- Together they ensure no issue is ever missed

### Basic Workflow
1. Create or update an issue in Source Org
2. Webhook triggers immediate sync to Target Org (1-3 seconds)
3. Updates, comments, attachments, links sync in real-time
4. Hourly scheduled sync validates all issues are in sync

### User Mapping
Map users between organizations to preserve assignee/reporter:
- Remote User → Local User
- Unmapped users default to unassigned

### Field Mapping
Sync custom fields by mapping field IDs:
- Remote Field → Local Field
- Sprint fields automatically extract sprint IDs
- Only mapped fields sync

### Status Mapping
Map status IDs when workflow names differ:
- Remote Status → Local Status
- Falls back to name matching if unmapped

### Project Filtering
Control which projects sync to reduce noise and focus on specific spaces:
1. Open admin UI → "Project Filter" section
2. Click "Load Projects" to fetch available projects
3. Check/uncheck projects you want to sync
4. Click "Save Project Filter"
5. **Behavior:**
   - **Projects selected:** Only selected projects sync
   - **No selection:** All projects sync (backward compatible)
   - Applies to webhooks, comments, and scheduled syncs

### Sync Health Dashboard
Monitor sync activity and troubleshoot issues:

**Real-time Webhook Syncs Section**
- Last activity timestamp
- Total syncs count
- Issues created, updated, and comments synced
- Recent errors with timestamps (top 5 shown)

**Scheduled Bulk Syncs Section**
- Last run timestamp and time elapsed
- Issues checked, created, updated, and skipped
- Success rate calculation
- Recent errors (top 5 shown)

**How to Access:**
1. Open admin UI → "Sync Health & Statistics" section
2. Click "Refresh Stats" to load latest data
3. Review metrics and errors to troubleshoot issues

### Manual Sync Controls
Take manual control when needed:

**Sync Specific Issue**
- Enter any issue key (e.g., "PROJ-123") to force immediate sync
- Useful for testing, debugging, or recovering from errors
- Bypasses normal sync conditions and forces create/update
- Shows success/error message with sync result
- Press Enter or click "Sync Now" button

**Clear Error History**
- "Clear Webhook Errors" - Resets webhook error tracking
- "Clear Scheduled Errors" - Resets scheduled sync error tracking
- Useful for fresh troubleshooting after fixing configuration
- Does not retry failed syncs, only clears the error log

**How to Access:**
1. Open admin UI → "Manual Sync Controls" section
2. Enter issue key and click "Sync Now" for on-demand sync
3. Click error clear buttons to reset error history

- 🔮 **Loop detection mechanism** - Prevent infinite sync loops
- 🔮 **Conflict resolution** - Last-write-wins vs manual merge strategies

## Troubleshooting

### Issues not syncing?
- **Check Sync Health Dashboard** - Open admin UI → "Sync Health & Statistics" → "Refresh Stats"
  - Review webhook stats for real-time sync activity
  - Review scheduled sync stats for bulk sync results
  - Check "Recent Errors" sections for specific error messages
- Check `forge logs` for detailed errors
- Verify remote credentials in admin UI
- Ensure user/field/status mappings saved
- Confirm project key is correct
- **Check project filter** - Verify project is in allowed list

### Understanding the dashboard?
- **Webhook stats show zeros** - No issues created/updated yet since deployment
- **Scheduled stats show zeros** - First hourly sync hasn't run yet (wait up to 1 hour)
- **High "Issues Skipped" count** - Normal; issues already in sync are skipped
- **Recent errors listed** - Click into logs with `forge logs` for full details

### Need to force sync an issue?
- Open admin UI → "Manual Sync Controls" section
- Enter the issue key (e.g., "PROJ-123")
- Click "Sync Now" to force immediate sync
- Check the success/error message returned
- Useful for testing or recovering from specific failures

### Only certain projects syncing?
- Open admin UI → "Project Filter" section
- Review "Currently Selected Projects" list
- If projects are selected, only those will sync
- To sync all projects: uncheck all and save (backward compatible)
- Check logs for: `⛔ Project X is NOT in allowed list`

### Attachments not syncing?
- Check file size (10MB limit)
- Verify download/upload permissions
- Check logs for specific errors
- Ensure storage mappings are working

### Issue links not syncing?
- Ensure linked issues exist in both orgs
- Verify both issues have been synced first
- Check link type exists in target org
- Review logs for skipped links

### Assignee not syncing?
- Load remote/local data in admin UI
- Add user mapping: Remote User → Local User
- Click "Save User Mappings"
- Create new issue to test

### Slow sync (5-10 minutes)?
- Normal: Forge cold starts take time
- Peak times: Jira webhook delays under load
- Solution: Sync usually completes in 1-3 seconds once triggered

### Comments delayed?
- Comment syncs instantly to API
- Jira UI may cache and delay display
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) to force update
